I'll be happy to hear from you if you use this firmware (email address is given in the user guide).

This project provides firmware for the "Pico Green Clock" product from Waveshare (available directly from Waveshare web site, or from Amazon).
It is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

Waveshare provides a basic firmware (Version 1.00) for the Pico Green clock. Current project adds tons of comments in the code and also provides many
enhancements and functionalities to the clock. You may refer to the user guide of the most recent version (included in this repository), and / or to the revision history in the source code to see the list of changes / enhancements.

Please take note that I'm not a Waveshare employee. This firmware is provided "as is" to help users develop their own code.
