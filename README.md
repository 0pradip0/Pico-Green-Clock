This project provides firmware for the "Pico Green Clock" product from Waveshare (available from Amazon). It is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller.

Waveshare provides a basic firmware (Version 1.00) for the Pico Green clock. Current project adds tons of comments in the code and also provides many
enhancements and functionalities to the clock. There are too many things added to be listed here. You may refer to the user guide of the most recent version
(included in this repository), and / or to the revision history in the source code to see the list of changes / enhancements.
